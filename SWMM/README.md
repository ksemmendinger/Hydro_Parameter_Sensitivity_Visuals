### Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) Model Configuration
- https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm
- Lumped modeling approach
- 24,000 SWMM model runs with parameter sets sampled from uniform distributions
- The model was configured with datasets from:
  - Web Soil Survey (NASS, USDA)
  - 2011 National Land Cover Dataset (USGS, 2014)
  - 2017 New York Crop Land Dataset (USDA, 2018)
