## Case Study 1:

### Project Title: A Study on Parsimonious Models in Catchments Generating Saturation Excess Runoff

#### Abstract
Given the National Water Model's (NWM) poor modeling of saturation excess runoff in coarse resolution watersheds, the team built a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model, based on TOPMODEL assumptions, which uses higher resolution topography and simple subsurface flow equations in a computationally efficient fashion to model overland flow. The study provided insight on the role of saturation excess runoff generation and suggest areas where the National Water Center (NWC) can apply this model.
